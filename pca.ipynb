    "Let $X = [x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_N]$ be a pxN matrix where samples are the columns of the matrix, each sample contains p\n",
    "features. Let $m = \\frac{1}{N} (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N)$ be the sample mean and we center each $x_i$ by $\\hat x_i = x_i - m$\n",

    "Let B be the new pxN matrix consists of centered samples $\\hat x_i$: $B = [\\hat x_1, ..., \\hat x_N]$, then B has zero\n",

    "Then $S = \\text{sample covariance matrix} = \\frac{1}{N - 1} (X - M)(X - M)^T = \\frac{1}{N -1} BB^T$ where $M = [m, m, ...]$\n",

    "The goal of PCA is to find an orthogonal pxp matrix $P = [u_1, ...., u_p]$ that determines a projection of X to a lower\n",

    "are uncorrelated and are arranged in decreasing variance order.\n",

    "The orthogonal matrix $P$ contains the unit eigenvectors $u_1, ..., u_p$ of the covariance matrix $S$ as columns, $u_1,\n",
    "u_2, ..., u_p$ are called principle components.\n",

    "The first PC is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $S$ and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "The first PC $u_1$ determine the new variable $y_i$ in the following way, $u_1$ is the first row of $P^T$, let $c_1, c_2\n",

    "\n",
    "$y_k = P^T \\hat x_k$ shows that $y_k^1 = c_1 x_k^1 + c_2 x_k^2 + ... + c_p x_k^p$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $y_k^i$ is just the dot product of $u_i$ and $x_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have a Nxp matrix X, with samples as rows, then the ith feature $y^i = Xu_i$**\n",

    "So, the stretching effect(Variance) is largest at $u_1$ with magnitude $\\lambda_1$.\n",

    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $tr(YY^T) = tr(P^TSP) = tr(P^TPS) = tr(S)$, the total variance preserves after the projection from X to Y\n",
